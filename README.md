# Knowledge Repo
This is an attempt to parse different knowledge bases using an LLM. My goal is leverage the ability of LLMs to compile multiple data source so that the user does not have to go over them manually, a time-intensive task.

I will be primarily using Langgraph for this, but most of the implementation will involve custom interfaces to process data. The goal is to add support for different data sources while keeping the dependency footprint minimal.
